## Overview

**Treeviz** addresses a common pain point for college students: course registration. Specifically, it tackles the challenge of tracking complex prerequisite chains when planning out a degree.

While current tools like DegreeWorks, GT Scheduler, and Oscar exist, they each fall short when it comes to giving students a clear, interactive path through their coursework. Treeviz fills this gap with a solution that is **intuitive**, **interactive**, and **tailored for Georgia Tech**.

## Problem Statement

Most Georgia Tech students run into issues when trying to plan out their courses across semesters. Long chains of prerequisites make it hard to decide which classes to take and when. Missing just one can delay graduation.

> Students may need complex chains of prerequisites to take a course in college, but it is difficult to find and track all of those prerequisites in order to make a plausible plan.
